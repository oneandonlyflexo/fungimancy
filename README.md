The Magical Mycological Minecraft Mod!

You find yourself in a deep and cloudy haze... Spores flitting about every which way, accompanied by the rare spark of magical energy.  Giant tree-like Mushrooms blot the landscape.  Out of your peripherals you see something.. you tell yourself it can't be what it seems, creatures more fungus than flesh.  As time passes while you stare at your surroundings, every breath you take brings with it more and more spores.  You begin to feel more comfortable in your surroundings... almost welcomed. 

Fungimancy is a [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net/) mod focused on living a life at one with mushrooms and fungi.  The idea came to me when creating a modpack with the idea of no trees or plants being available except mushrooms.  This lead to me needing to create mushroom "trees" that would give the player access to a wood substitute. The idea of a mushroom themed mod exploded in my mind and here we are!  Many of the ideas and themes that I've come up with have been influenced or inspired by some other magic mods.  Most notabley: [Witchery](https://sites.google.com/site/witcherymod/) and [Botania](http://botaniamod.net/).

The current version of Fungimancy is... non-existent! With Version number 0.0 and everything, but I'm working on version 0.1.  This is my first forge mod, so it'll be a learning process to say the least.  If anyone actually finds this text and is reading it, firstly.. Hello! And secondly, please bare with me as I get this whole process figured out.
