## The Magical Mycological Minecraft Mod!

You find yourself in a deep and cloudy haze... Spores flitting about every which 
way, accompanied by the rare spark of magical energy.  Giant tree-like Mushrooms 
blot the landscape.  Out of your peripherals you see something.. you tell 
yourself it can't be what it seems, creatures more fungus than flesh.  As time 
passes while you stare at your surroundings, every breath you take brings with 
it more and more spores.  You begin to feel more comfortable in your 
surroundings... almost welcomed. 

Fungimancy is a mod focused on living a life at one with mushrooms and fungi.  
The idea came to me when creating a modpack with the idea of no trees or plants 
being available except mushrooms.  This lead to me needing to create mushroom 
"trees" that would give the player access to a wood substitute. The idea of a 
mushroom themed mod exploded in my mind and here we are!  Many of the ideas and 
themes that I've come up with have been influenced or inspired by some other 
magic mods.  Most notabley: [Witchery](https://sites.google.com/site/witcherymod/) 
and [Botania](http://botaniamod.net/).
